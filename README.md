# unity-fps-1
This project is a multiplayer FPS game made in Unity. My goals in doing this project are to learn the basics of making an FPS-type game, to learn Unity's networking API, and to make my ideal first person character controller. In making the character controller, I implemented mechanics that I have found fun to use in my experiences playing FPSes, including bunnyhopping and leaning. Currently, this game makes use of Unity's networking API and services to connect players, who can kill each other by shooting (raycast implementation). This was made using various online sources, including many tutorials on Youtube (Brackeys, quill18) and Source Engine movement code.

Here are gifs of the some of the game's functionalities:
