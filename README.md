# unity-fps-1
This project is a multiplayer FPS game made in Unity. My goals in doing this project are to learn the basics of making an FPS-type game, to learn Unity's networking API, and to make my ideal first person character controller. The game's character controller was heavily inspired by big-name FPSes, including Counter-Strike (bunnyhopping) and Rainbow Six Siege (leaning). Currently, this game makes use of Unity's networking API and services to connect players, who can kill each other by shooting. This was made using various online sources, including many tutorials on Youtube (Brackeys, quill18) and Source Engine movement code.

Here are gifs of the some of the game's functionalities:
